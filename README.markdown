Spotstock
=========

The Spotstock site was used to promote a week-long virtual festival that I put on for my friends.  The site is (at the time of writing) running at [http://spotstock.heroku.com](http://spotstock.heroku.com).

If you want to make this run, you'll need to add bit.ly credentials to admin_controller and probably uncomment the admin route in routes.rb.

Spotstock was written on Friday for a festival that began on the Monday.  It is a simple site with no tests and it is mostly static.  I know that the bit.ly credentials should be in a config file.  Sorry.
